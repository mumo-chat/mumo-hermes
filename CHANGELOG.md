## 0.1.5 — 2026-05-22

Cosmetic alignment to the conventions used by approved optional skills in the `NousResearch/hermes-agent` catalog (sampled `dcf-model`, `kanban-video-orchestrator`, `concept-diagrams`). No functional changes. Sets up a single source-of-truth artifact for the upcoming HermesHub PR submission — the canonical SKILL.md here and the contribution copy at `optional-skills/software-development/mumo/` are now identical, no separate PR-version frontmatter to maintain.

- **`version` unquoted** — `version: "0.1.4"` → `version: 0.1.5`. YAML parses both as the same string; matches the unquoted style every approved optional skill uses.
- **Tags lowercased** — `Deliberation`, `Decision-Support`, `Multi-Model`, `Design-Review`, `Architecture-Review`, `Plan-Review`, `MCP` → `deliberation`, `decision-support`, `multi-model`, `design-review`, `architecture-review`, `plan-review`, `mcp`. Tags are author-defined free text; lowercase is the source-of-truth convention. (Title-Case in earlier samples was just the docs-site display rendering.)
- **`required_environment_variables` + `metadata.hermes.requires_tools` retained.** Neither field appears in the optional-skill samples we checked, but both are per the canonical `creating-skills` developer-guide doc. Keeping them means: hub-installed users get the interactive `MUMO_API_KEY` prompt (if Hermes honors the field) and the skill auto-hides when mumo MCP isn't registered. Both should be harmlessly ignored by parsers that don't recognize them. If the upstream PR review asks to drop, we'll drop them at that point.

## 0.1.4 — 2026-05-21

Re-categorized, frontmatter realigned to canonical Hermes schema, and SKILL.md content now sourced from the shared `mumo-chat/mumo-mcp` baseline via the build-skill.js renderer. v0.1.3 sampled HermesHub conventions; this revision grounds them against the canonical docs (creating-skills, mcp-config-reference, skills user-guide) and real bundled-skill frontmatter (`claude-code`, `native-mcp`, `mcporter`, `fastmcp`).

- **Re-categorized to `software-development/`.** Install path is now `~/.hermes/skills/software-development/mumo`. The `autonomous-ai-agents/` cluster is for skills that delegate to *another autonomous agent* (Claude Code, Codex). mumo is a *tool* the native Hermes agent calls to run a deliberation panel — the structured-methodology-before-acting cousin of `writing-plans`, `plan`, and `requesting-code-review`.
- **Frontmatter cleanup.** `author` moved back to top-level (v0.1.3 had it under `metadata.author`; real hub skills like `claude-code` and `native-mcp` use top-level). Dropped `compatibility` and `metadata.hermes.category: agents` — neither is in the canonical schema. Added `platforms: [linux, macos, windows]`, `required_environment_variables` for `MUMO_API_KEY` (enables the interactive install prompt for hub installs), and `metadata.hermes.related_skills: [writing-plans, plan, requesting-code-review]`.
- **`metadata.hermes.requires_tools: [mcp_mumo_create_deliberation]`** — hides the skill from all discovery surfaces (system prompt index, `skills_list()`, `/mumo` slash command) when mumo's MCP server isn't registered. Prevents users from seeing a skill they can't use.
- **Tags restructured** to 7 Title-Case keywords matching real-world hub-skill style: `Deliberation`, `Decision-Support`, `Multi-Model`, `Design-Review`, `Architecture-Review`, `Plan-Review`, `MCP`. The `[Category, Subcategory, Keywords]` positional convention from the dev docs turned out to be aspirational — real skills use flat capitalized lists.
- **Description rewritten** to lead with a WHAT verb and explicit "Use when..." clause. Drops the "Requires the mumo MCP server to be configured" tail since `requires_tools` handles that precondition structurally.
- **MCP config polish** (`config/mumo.yaml`): added `supports_parallel_tool_calls: true`; explicit `connect_timeout: 60` + `timeout: 180` aligned with `wait_for_round` defaults.
- **README rewritten** around the new positioning. `hermes skills install mumo` from HermesHub is the recommended install (prompts for `MUMO_API_KEY` automatically); git-clone fallback documented with the new path. `/mumo` slash-command invocation called out — Hermes skills are explicitly invoked, never auto-triggered.
- **`reference/` → `references/`** (plural, per cross-ecosystem standardization). Added `recap.md` covering the `recap_round` / `recap_session` flags from the recent MCP server iteration.
- **Build-system sourced.** SKILL.md is now rendered from `mumo-chat/mumo-mcp/skills/mumo/SKILL.template.md` via `node scripts/build-skill.js --target hermes`. Per-client overlay (Setup, frontmatter, install URL, application name, moderator example, tool-naming note) lives in `mumo-mcp/scripts/clients/hermes/`. Manual edits to this `SKILL.md` get overwritten on next render — edit at the baseline source.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-05-05

Frontmatter aligned with HermesHub conventions after sampling existing hub skills (notion-integration, api-builder, agent-hardening, synapse-swarm). v0.1.2 used the generic agentskills.io shape; this matches what the hub actually ships.

- **`version`** now string-quoted (`"0.1.3"`).
- **`author`** moved under `metadata.author` (hub convention; top-level `author` is non-canonical for hermeshub).
- **`compatibility`** field added — pointer to `mumo.chat/settings/api-keys` for the platform key.
- **`metadata.hermes.category: agents`** — same bucket as synapse-swarm and paperclip (multi-agent collaboration).
- **Tags** rewritten in flow style to match hub convention.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-05-05

Frontmatter cleanup ahead of HermesHub submission. No body changes.

- **Frontmatter completed** — added `version`, `author`, `license`, and `metadata.hermes.tags` (deliberation, multi-model, mcp, decision-support, ai-tooling) per Hermes' creating-skills guide. Brings v0.1.x in line with hub frontmatter conventions.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-05

Skill refinements from first real Hermes deliberation, plus a layout fix. The v0.1.0 skill produced clean end-to-end behavior (real tool calls, auto-chained wait, confident synthesis); these edits sharpen the framing.

- **Repo restructured** — root is now the skill root (was `skills/mumo/`). Cloning the repo into `~/.hermes/skills/<category>/mumo/` now places `SKILL.md` at the canonical path Hermes' scanner expects, instead of one level too deep.
- **"When to use" reframed** around the three conditions Hermes' own synthesis identified: wide solution space + hidden failure space; medium-high confidence + anchoring risk; irreversible consequences. The longer trigger taxonomy stays as supporting detail. Added the "cognitive load balancer" framing to position mumo against your reasoning, not as a replacement for it.
- **Long-wait guidance** in basic loop step 3: 15–120s is normal, 60+ seconds isn't a failure signal. Tell the user upfront so the wait doesn't feel broken.
- **Recovery section** for lost session context: use `list_sessions` to find your latest session by prompt match, then `get_session` or `wait_for_round` instead of starting a duplicate deliberation.
- **Terminology section** distinguishing panel/models/participants (what mumo invokes on its backend) from subagent (your own delegation infrastructure). Hermes' first synthesis conflated the two; this section heads off the category error in future synthesis.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-05

Initial release. Hermes Agent skill for mumo's MCP server.

- `skills/mumo/SKILL.md` — kernel teaching the deliberation loop, snippet doctrine, claim-map reading, when-to-invoke triggers, and the verification discipline (real session IDs are UUIDs; verify with `list_sessions` if uncertain).
- `skills/mumo/playbooks/` — four cognitive-shape playbooks: `contested-decision`, `design-review`, `uncertainty-expansion`, `red-team`.
- `skills/mumo/reference/` — five reference docs: `claim-maps`, `snippets`, `model-selection`, `synthesis`, `operating-notes`.
- `config/mumo.yaml` — MCP server entry to merge into `~/.hermes/config.yaml` with `tools.include` allowlist scoping mumo to its seven tools.
- README install steps: clone repo into `~/.hermes/skills/`, add YAML config, restart Hermes.

Derived from the shared v0.2.x skill kernel that originated in mumo-mcp and mumo-cursor, adapted for Hermes' YAML-based MCP config and tool naming conventions. Note: mumo-vscode no longer ships `skills/` in the published `.vsix` (excluded as of v0.3.0), since VS Code's Copilot doesn't consume `SKILL.md` at runtime — the kernel is shared in spirit, not in a runtime sense.
